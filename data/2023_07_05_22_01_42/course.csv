Today's successful companies are those that most effectively generate, protect, and exploit new and valuable business ideas. Over the past 40 years, intellectual capital has emerged as the leading assets class.  Ocean Tomo&reg; estimates that over 80% of the market value of S&amp;P 500 corporations now stems from intangible assets, which consist largely of intellectual property (IP) assets (e.g., the company and product names, logos and designs; patentable inventions; proprietary software and databases, and other proprietary product, manufacturing and marketing information). It is therefore vital for entrepreneurs and other business professionals to have a basic understanding of IP and how it is procured, protected, and exploited. This course provides an overview of the many and varied IP issues that students will confront during their careers. It is intended to be both informative and fun. Classes will cover the basics of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret law. Current issues in these areas will be covered, including patent protection for software and business methods, copyrightability of computer programs and APIs, issues relating to artificial intelligence, and the evolving protection for trademarks and trade secrets.  Emerging issues concerning the federal Computer Fraud &amp; Abuse Act (CFAA) and hacking will be covered, as will employment issues, including employee proprietary information and invention assignment agreements, work made for hire agreements, confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements and other potential post-employment restrictions. Recent notable lawsuits will be discussed, including Apple v. Samsung (patents), Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (software and business method patents), Oracle v. Google (software/APIs), Waymo v. Uber (civil and criminal trade secret theft), and hiQ v. LinkedIn (CFAA). IP law evolves constantly and new headline cases that arise during the term are added to the class discussion.

Undeniably, algorithms are informing decisions that reach ever more deeply into our lives, from news article recommendations to criminal sentencing decisions to healthcare diagnostics. This progress, however, raises (and is impeded by) a host of concerns regarding the societal impact of computation. A prominent concern is that these algorithms should be fair. Unfortunately, the hope that automated decision-making might be free of social biases is dashed on the data on which the algorithms are trained and the choices in their construction: left to their own devices, algorithms will propagate - even amplify - existing biases of the data, the programmers, and the decisions made in the choice of features to incorporate and measurements of 'fitness' to be applied. Addressing wrongful discrimination by algorithms is not only mandated by law and by ethics but is essential to maintaining the public trust in the current computation-driven revolution.The study of fairness is ancient and multi-disciplinary: philosophers, legal experts, economists, statisticians, social scientists and others have been concerned with fairness for as long as these fields have existed.

The scale of software engineering data has permitted machine learning and statistical approaches to imagine tools that are beyond the capabilities of traditional, semantics-based approaches. In this graduate seminar, students will learn the various ways in which code and related artifacts can be treated as data, and how various developer tools can be built by applying machine learning over this data.

Students will learn to be part of a deadline-driven software development effort working to meet the needs of a theater director and creative specialists -- while communicating the effect of resource limits and constraints to a nontechnical audience. This is an experimental hands-on laboratory class, and our direction may shift as the creative needs of the theatrical production evolve. Based on the success of class projects and subsequent needs, some students may be invited to continue in the winter term with a research appointment (for pay or credit) to operate the system you have built and instruct actors and creative professionals how to work with the system through rehearsals and the final performance before spring break.
